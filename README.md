# Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe AI: A Journey from Charmander to Charizard üê≤

Welcome to this unique exploration of the Minimax algorithm, presented through the lens of a Tic-Tac-Toe playing program. This project was crafted as a supplementary resource for an upcoming YouTube video on my channel, where we dive deep into the intricacies of game theory and AI algorithms, using the world of Pok√©mon as a fun metaphor.

## Features

- **[Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax):** The backbone of our AI, enabling it to make optimal decisions at every turn.

- **[Alpha Beta Pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning):** A refinement to the Minimax algorithm that helps the program make decisions faster.

- **Bit Boards:** A space-efficient method to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board using binary representation. (Note: While bitboards are commonly used in board games like chess, a direct link for tic-tac-toe might not exist, so I'm leaving it without a link.)

- **Winning Combinations:** Utilizes binary operations to efficiently check for winning conditions. This rapid evaluation ensures a faster gameplay experience.

- **Prolong When Losing Strategy:** Delays the opponent's victory even when losing seems inevitable.

- **Transposition Table:** Optimizes searches by remembering past states.

- **Basic Strategy:** When the search tree becomes too large to be explored by Minimax in a reasonable time, this strategy helps the AI play good moves quickly. While these moves might not always be the best, they're generally very competitive.

- **Scalability:** Our AI can play Tic-Tac-Toe on any board size.
